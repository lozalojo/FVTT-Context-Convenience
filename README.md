# Context Convenience

A selection of convenient utility actions to sidebar right-click menus.

## Functionality

### üìÅ Global Folder Actions

Actions available on all sidebar folders.

#### Sort Ascending/Descending

Sort entities in any folder alphabetically either ascending or descending.

#### Set Default Permissions

Set the "Default" permission level on all entities in the folder.

### üó∫Ô∏è Scene Folder Actions

#### Show/Hide in Navigation

Shows or hides all scenes in a folder in the top navigation bar.

### üßë Actor Entity Actions

#### Edit Prototype Token

Open the prototype token configuration for an actor without needing to open that actor's sheet.

## API

Utility functions are available in `game.ctxConvenience` for much of the available context menu actions. In some cases, these functions expose parameters beyond what is available in the context menu. For instance, `game.ctxConvenience.folders.sortFolderContents` exposes a `cmp` parameter that lets you define the comparison function that will be used to sort the entities in the folder.

## Compatibility

Should be compatible with just about anything, though there may be some overlap with other modules which add similar functionality, for instance "The Furnace" adds similar sorting items in the folder context menu.
